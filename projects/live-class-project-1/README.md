# Live Class Project 1

# Developer

# My Learnings
This project was fun, used CSS selectors to apply styling, used `z-index`, `position` to get same results as design. the new thing i learnt in this particular project is, the border at nav-item's bottom side. acheived that design using `::after` pseudo-selector.
