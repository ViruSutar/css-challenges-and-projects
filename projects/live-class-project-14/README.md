# My Learnings
In Project 14, this was different design to implement, but done with `position: fixed`, with the flow it became easy to code and design, learnt new CSS property to give stoke to Text `-webkit-text-stroke-width: 1px`, `-webkit-text-stroke-color: #888;`. Enjoyed this project, it was quite challenging, but yes, without challenge we can't learn :)
